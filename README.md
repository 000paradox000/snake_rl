# Snake RL: A pedagogical project to begin Reinforcement Learning

Snake RL is a simple project that implements Proximal Policy Optimization to train a model play a simple Snake game created with pygame.

## How It Works

First create a virtual environment (python 3.11) and install the requirements.

1. **Play Snake Yourself** Run the following command ```python main.py```
2. **Train a Model** Run the following command ```python train.py```
3. **Make the Model Play** Run the following command ```python model_play.py``` once a model have been trained
